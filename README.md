# Tindog Project for Udemy Fullstack Developer Course

This is a project I completed whilst studying the Udemy Complete Frontend Developers Course 2020.

The aim was to create a fictional dating app for dogs. In order to complete this I created a single landing <strong>HTML</strong> page with an adjoining <strong>CSS</strong> doc for styling as well as <strong>Bootstrap</strong> libraries.

Within the HTML page, I created a <em>Header</em> with a <em>Navbar</em> which housed the website's logo and 3 links to other sections on the page. 

The 3 sections are: 
<ul>        
    <li>Features</li>
    <li>Testimonials & Press</li>
    <li>Pricing</li>
</ul>

Below the sections I finish with a <em>footer</em> to tie up the design of the page included with social media and copyright information.

This was a great introduction to using Bootstrap libraries and a fun way to practice HTML and CSS. The final product was a very attractive and interactive site with great UX.
