# Tindog Project for Udemy Fullstack Developer Course

This is a project I completed whilst studying the Udemy Complete Frontend Developers Course 2020.

The aim was to create a fictional dating app for dogs. In order to complete this I created a single landing HTML page with an adjoining CSS doc for styling as well as BOOTSTRAP libraries.

Within the HTML page, I created a Header with a Navbar which housed the websites logo and 3 links to other sections on the page.

There are 3 sections: 
<ul>
    <li>Features</li>
    <li>Testimonials & Press</li>
    <li>Pricing</li>
</ul>
